## About The AUC24/MIC Calculator <a name="about"></a>

This vancomycin calculator uses a variety of published pharmacokinetic equations and principles to estimate an initial vancomycin dosing regimen for a patient based on population estimates. Subsequently, a regimen may be calculated based two vancomycin levels for severe MRSA infections. The AUC24/MIC is calculated using the trapezoidal method.
